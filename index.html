                The term "paradox" refers to a statement, proposition, or situation that seems self-contradictory or logically absurd, yet may be true. Paradoxes often challenge our understanding of reality and logic, leading to contemplation and deeper insights. They are prevalent in various fields, including philosophy, mathematics, logic, and literature. Some famous examples of paradoxes include the liar paradox , Zeno's paradoxes, which challenge the notion of motion and continuity. Paradoxes are often used to illustrate logical puzzles, highlight the limitations of language or reasoning, and stimulate intellectual inquiry.

                Web developers typically use these tools and technologies to build and maintain websites and web applications. Each tool serves a specific purpose within the development process, from defining the structure and content of web pages (HTML), to styling them (CSS), adding functionality and interactivity (JavaScript), and storing and managing data (MongoDB and SQL).

                    <p class="skill-description">Vanilla JavaScript refers to the use of plain, pure JavaScript code without relying on any additional libraries or frameworks. It simply means using the core JavaScript language and its built-in features to accomplish tasks, manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), handle events, and interact with APIs.</p>

                    <p class="skill-description">React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It's widely used for creating interactive and dynamic web applications. React is known for its component-based architecture, which allows developers to build reusable UI elements and compose them together to create complex user interfaces.</p>

                    <p class="skill-description">Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling you to build scalable, networked applications. Node.js is commonly used for building web servers, but it's also used for various other purposes, such as building command-line tools, real-time applications, APIs, and microservices.</p>

                    <p class="skill-description">MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database management system that is known for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. Unlike traditional relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL, MongoDB stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON), which allows for more dynamic and schema-less data structures.</p>
